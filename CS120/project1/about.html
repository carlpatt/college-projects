  <h1>A Summary About Me</h1>
  <p class="text">
    My name is Carl Patterson. I am a Compouter Science major at LIU Brooklyn.
    I was born on the island of Jamaica, which is a small island less than 200Km
    south of Cuba (I heard from my mother that when she was a child you could use
    some kind of telescope at the top of the Negril lighthouse to see Cuba).

  <p class="text">
    I love pursuing my hobbies and also spending time with friends and loved ones
    just as much as anyone else. Dogs are my favourite animal and i find cats
    okay too (although I don't trust them).
