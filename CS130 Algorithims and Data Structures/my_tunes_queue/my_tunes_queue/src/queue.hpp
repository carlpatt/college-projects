 * ---------
 * This function accepts a QUEUE* parameter as a function parameter
 * and returns true if the queue is empty and false otherwise. A queue
 * is empty when the front index of the queue follows the rear index of
 * the queue in a circular sense. For example, if front is set to 23 and
 * rear is set to 22, the queue is empty. Likewise, if front is set to 0
 * and rear is set to MAX_SIZE - 1, the queue is also empty because
 * 0 follows MAX_SIZE - 1 in the circular sense.

 * The elements are added to the end of the queue. If the queue does not
 * have the capacity to hold all of the elements, elements are
 * added to the queue until it is full. The function returns the number
 * of elements from the new_elements array that were added to the queue.
 * Therefore, if new_elements contains m elements and all elements are

 * must implement an algorithm that has an asymptotic runtime of

 * r_idx is removed from the queue, any elements in the queue after the
 * removed element are moved 1 index closer to the front of the queue, the
 * rear index is decreased by 1, and the function returns true. If element
 * is not in the queue, the function returns false and no changes are made
 * to the queue.

 * ---------
 * This function accepts a QUEUE*, an int (first), and an int (second) as
 * function parameters. If both indices are between front and rear, the
 * position of the elements are swapped so that after this function
 * executes the element previously at second will be located at first and
 * the element previously at first will be located at second. If the swap
 * is successfully performed, the function returns true, otherwise, the
 * function returns false.
